# Jeopardy Category Data with Labels
A revision of the 2021-22 Jeopardy! topic classification work previously used for studying, and now for other analysis.

This contains the following files:
* jeopardy clue data - 2026 methods overview.ipynb, a file containing all of the python code used to develop this analysis and instructions on how it was used
* cats_with_tags_final_2025.csv, the labels applied to each of the approximately 56,000 categories that have been used on Jeopardy! since 1984 and prediction scores for each possible label; can be filtered to "category," "max_predict," and "second_max_predict" for most use cases
* pop_count_12252025.csv, a file summarizing the number of tagged "pop culture" columns in each episode of Jeopardy!

Additional files anc acknowledgments to be added later.
